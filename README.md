## Description
This project is a candidate search application that uses TypeScript and the GitHub API to search for and display candidates. Users can save or skip candidates during the search process. Saved candidates are stored locally for future reference. The project demonstrates integration with a third-party API (GitHub) and provides a simple interface for managing candidate data.
